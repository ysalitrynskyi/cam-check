A simple, privacy-focused macOS menu bar utility to quickly test your camera's indicator light.

## Features

- **Instant Test:** Quickly turn your camera's indicator light on for a few seconds to ensure it's functioning correctly.
- **Privacy Focused:** The app does not view, record, or transmit any camera data. It only activates the hardware to test the light.
- **Menu Bar Native:** Lives discreetly in your menu bar for easy access.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal and efficient, with no impact on your system's performance.
